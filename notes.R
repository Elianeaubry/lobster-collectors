Notes:

- People seem to be seeing smaller and smaller instars, try and determine the mean instar sizes and
  abundances through time

- There are worries about delays in deployement or retrieval times. Can we use these to to predict
       recrtuitment observations? Can we use depth or temperature observations?
          
- Why don't we do suction sampling? 

- How do we deal with changes in deployment or retrieval dates?


- Do figure on deployment and retrieval dates for each site through the years.
