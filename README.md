# Lobster collectors

Lobster collector data and analyses

Larvae collectors are placed near-shore and sampled annually in the fall. 

## Young-of-the-year estimation

The main focus of collector data is to produce estimates young-of-the-year (yoy) lobster, i.e. first-year population recruits at each of the sampling sites. 

However, sampled animals from the collectors also contain older, mobile lobster, which have wandered in from the surrounding substrate, called 'walk-ins', which must be separated from the young-of-the-year samples.

This partitioning of the samples is produced via a length-frequency, sometimes using a simple size threshold value, or sometimes more involved methods such as finite mixture analyses.
