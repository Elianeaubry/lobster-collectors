# Lobster collectors

Lobster collector data and analyses

Larvae collectors are placed near-shore and sampled annually in the fall. 

## Young-of-the-year estimation

First-year recruits (i.e. young-of-the-year) of Atlantic lobster (Homarus americanus) and 
rock crab (Cancer irroratus) were counted and measured using larval settlement collectors 
at various coastal sampling sites in the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada. This project
is part of a larger Atlantic Lobster Settlement Index (ALSI) program which spans a large part
of the species' western Atlantic range.

Collectors are specially contruncted cages (dimensions?) containing gravel and rock substrate
deemed suitable for settlement of American lobster larvae. Sets of 30 collectors are placed at
each site. Collectors are deployed in early summer and rertrieved in early fall, before and after the 
larval settlement period, respectively.
            
However, sampled animals from the collectors also contain older, mobile lobster, which have wandered in from the surrounding substrate, called 'walk-ins', which must be separated from the young-of-the-year samples. This partitioning of the samples is produced via a length-frequency analysis, sometimes using a simple size threshold value, or more involved methods, such as finite mixture analyses.
