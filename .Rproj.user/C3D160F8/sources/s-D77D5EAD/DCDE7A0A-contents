## Minilogs

* Ahead of the sampling season, all Minilog probes will be suspended in an equilibrated ice-bucket, i.e. with moving water to compare their **baseline temperatures**. Probes with too large a bias (> $0.5^{o}$C) will not be used the the collector study. 

* In preparation for the sampling season, **DFO Science representative will communicate** with stakeholders (e.g. fishing associations or provincial representatives) to determine whether they have the desire or intention of placing new collectors at a new site in the coming sampling year. Extra Minilog probes may be provided for that purpose.

* When Minilog are initialized, internal clocks will be set to **daylight saving time**, i.e. summer season time, even when set during the winter season, to avoid chronological inconsistencies between devices. 

* When downloading Minilog temperature data from recovered probes, the **date and the difference between the Minilog internal clocks and the actual time will be recorded**. This ensures that a time correction can be perfomed on the Minilog time stamps.

* The sampling **site and year** will be encoded in both the Minilog file name and the file's header information.

## Collector coordinates

* Every, collector site coordinates will be recorded for the regular sampling group of collectors, as well as any additional group of collectors which may have been added (e.g. deep-water groups).
