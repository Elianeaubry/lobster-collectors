## Other Research Goals

Other than providing local young-of-the-year recruitment estimates, larval collectors data may provide other information of interest.

### Influence of Water Temperature 

Temperature data gathered by attached probes at the collector sampling sites will be analysed to determine their possible influence on larval recruitment rates. 

### Local Growth Variation

Length-frequency analysis of collector data provide the possibility of identifying, quantifying and estimating the mean sizes of lobster instars. This can provide some insight on variations in local growth and moult patterns.

### Local Landings Prediction

Recruitment indices may  be used to construct a predictive model of future landings when taking growth and mortality into account. This is especially relevant given the scarcity of fishery-independent data for estimating or predicting commericial lobster abudnances.
