## Other Research Goals

Other than providing local young-of-the-year recruitment estimates, larval collectors data may provide other information of interest.

### Influence of Water Temperature 

Information about local temperature regimes and their possible influence on larval recruitment. 

### Local Growth Variation

Length-frequency analysis of collector data provide the possibility of identifying, quantifying and estimating the mean sizes of lobster instars. This can provide some insight on variations in local growth and moult patterns.

### Local Landings Prediction
Recruitment indices may  be used to construct a predictive model of future landings when taking growth and mortality into account. This is especially relevant given the scarcity of fishery-independent data for estimating or predicting commericial lobster abudnances.
