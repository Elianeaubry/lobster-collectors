Starting in 2008, first-year recruits (i.e. young-of-the-year) of Atlantic lobster (*Homarus americanus*) and rock crab (*Cancer irroratus*) were counted and measured using larval settlement collectors at various coastal sampling sites in the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada. This project is part of the Atlantic Lobster Settlement Index (**ALSI**) program which spans a large part of the species' western Atlantic range, from Cape cod, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence, coastal Nova Scotia and Eastern and Northern Newfoundland.
